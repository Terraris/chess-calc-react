# Chess Calculation App

Welcome to Chess Calculation App, a React application designed to help calculate the possible moves for a chess piece. 
It pairs with a running backend of [Chess Calc](https://github.com/Terraris/chess-calc). Just like the Chess Scenario 
Generator client, this React app tests out various chess pieces and their movements.


## Features

- **Interactive Board UI**: Users can input their chess piece's current coordinates onto an interactive format.
- **Coordinate Calculation**: The server-side calculations are done restfully. Once the coordinates are inputted, 
- the app takes care of the rest by showing movement possibilities for the selected piece.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and can be used on various device sizes.
- **User-friendly Interface**: With an intuitive design, users can easily navigate through the application.

## Requirements

The Chess Calculation App was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In order to build and run this application, you will need:

- Node.js
- npm

All project dependencies are managed through npm, which is bundled with Node.js.

## Setting Up and Running the Project

After cloning this repository, navigate to its directory and run the following commands:

#### To install the dependencies:

### `npm install`

#### To start the application in development mode:

### `npm start`

This starts the app in development mode and opens it in the browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will reload if 
you make edits, and any lint errors will display in the console.

#### To build the application for production:
### `npm run build`

This builds the app for production in the build folder, bundling React in production mode for optimal performance.
